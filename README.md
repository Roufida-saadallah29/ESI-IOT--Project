# ESI-IOT--Project
As part of our web development mini-project, we have developed a web application to manage IoT components. The application is designed to meet the following requirements:

 1.  Insertion of a new component: each component has a name, an image (automatically retrieved after entering the name),
    a purchase date, a quantity, and a status (available, faulty, lost).
 2.  Modification and deletion of components.
 3.  Retrieval of the list of components.
 4.  Filtering of components based on several criteria (by purchase date, by status) using AJAX.
 5.  Generation of an Excel file containing all components or based on a filter.
 6.  Generation of a discharge note based on the attached Word template.
